  - title: "Why XAI-Ed@LAK26?"
    image: "/images/service-2.png"
    content: "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes deeply embedded in educational technologies and Learning Analytics (LA), the demand for transparency, trust, and fairness has never been greater. Yet, explainability remains an underexplored dimension of LA practice. Many analytics and AI models still operate as opaque “black boxes,” limiting educators’ and learners’ ability to interpret results, act upon insights, or evaluate fairness.\nThe XAI-Ed 2026 workshop responds to this challenge by positioning Explainable AI (XAI) and Explainable Learning Analytics (XLA) as essential enablers of trustworthy, participatory, and equitable education. It brings together researchers and practitioners to bridge the gap between algorithmic predictions and stakeholder understanding—linking technical advances in model interpretability with pedagogical principles, ethical responsibility, and institutional practice.\nThrough presentations, panels, and collaborative sessions, the workshop will explore approaches ranging from intrinsic and post-hoc explainability to the use of large language models (LLMs) for adaptive explanations. It will foreground issues of bias, accountability, and compliance, and emphasize stakeholder-sensitive, actionable explanations that empower educators and learners to make informed decisions."

  - title: "Workshop Goals and Objectives"
    image: "/images/service-1.png"
    content: "The overarching goal of XAI-Ed 2026 is to advance a shared agenda for human-centered, explainable learning analytics. Specifically, the workshop seeks to:"
    bulletpoints:
      - "**Integrate explainability** into the core of **LA research and practice**, promoting interpretability and stakeholder empowerment rather than post-hoc justification."
      - "**Foster interdisciplinary knowledge exchange** across computer science, pedagogy, ethics, and institutional policy to co-design explainable and trustworthy systems."
      - "**Support equity and fairness** by identifying and mitigating algorithmic bias in educational analytics."
      - "Examine **evaluation methods for XAI and XLA**, including metrics for explanation faithfulness, usefulness, and usability."
      - "Explore the **role of LLMs and generative AI** in producing **stakeholder-aware**, **context-sensitive** explanations."
      - "**Develop strategies for institutional adoption** of XAI-enabled learning analytics that align with educational values and regulatory frameworks."


  - title: "Expected Outcomes"
    image: "/images/service-2.png"
    content: "Ultimately, XAI-Ed 2026 aims to help transform learning analytics into a more transparent, participatory, and ethically grounded practice—one that delivers not only accurate predictions but also actionable, explainable, and equitable insights that strengthen learner and educator agency. By the end of the workshop, participants will have:"
    bulletpoints:
      - "A shared understanding of current challenges and opportunities in XAI and XLA."
      - "Practical strategies for designing and evaluating stakeholder-sensitive explanations."
      - "A roadmap for integrating explainability into institutional analytics and policy frameworks."
      - "New collaborative connections across technical, pedagogical, and policy domains."
