## Workshop Scope

This edition of **XAI-Ed 2026** seeks to consolidate methodological, theoretical, and empirical perspectives on explainability in education. We aim to complement technical implementations with shared frameworks that integrate explainability into pedagogical design, stakeholder engagement, and institutional decision-making.

The workshop encourages contributions that:

- Theorize the role of explainability in supporting learning processes, reflection, and teacher facilitation;  
- Investigate methods, data representations, and visualization approaches that enhance interpretability;  
- Evaluate the usefulness and faithfulness of explanations from multiple stakeholder perspectives;  
- Explore the intersection of large language models (LLMs), generative AI, and explainable learning analytics;  
- Discuss the ethical, legal, and policy dimensions of transparency and accountability in educational AI.  

Through paper presentations, interactive sessions, and collective discussion, **XAI-Ed 2026** aims to build a coherent research agenda for explainability as a cornerstone of human-centered, trustworthy learning analytics.



## Topics of Interest

Submissions may address (but are not limited to):

- Explainability and transparency in learning analytics  
- Evaluation metrics and frameworks for educational XAI/XLA  
- Pedagogical and cognitive foundations of explanations  
- Stakeholder-sensitive explanation design and user evaluation  
- Fairness, bias, and accountability in AI-enabled LA systems  
- Institutional and policy challenges in adopting XAI and XLA  
- Ethical, legal, and regulatory aspects of transparency and explainability in LA  
- Role of LLMs and generative AI in supporting explainability and learner reflection in LA  
- Case studies, prototypes, and empirical findings demonstrating XAI/XLA in educational contexts  


## Submission Types

- **Full Research Papers (6–10 pages):** Novel empirical results, methods, frameworks, systems, or datasets related to XAI/XLA.  
- **Short Papers (4–6 pages):** Including work in progress, positional papers, conceptual frameworks, theoretical perspectives, and practitioner reports.  

Page limits include references. Optional appendices (e.g., instruments, algorithms, dataset details) do not count toward the limit but will be treated as supplementary (reviewers are not required to read them).


## Formatting & Submission

- All submissions should use the workshop’s template (Word or LaTeX), based on the **CEUR-WS proceedings template**.  
- Submissions must be **anonymous** for double-blind review. Remove all author names and identifying information (e.g., grant numbers), and refer to prior work in the third person (e.g., “Previously, Smith et al. did … [1]” rather than “In our prior work [1]”).  
- Submissions are to be made via **XAI-Ed 2026 Workshop on EasyChair**.
