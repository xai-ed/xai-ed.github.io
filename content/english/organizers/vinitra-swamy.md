Vinitra Swamy is a postdoctoral researcher at EPFL. Her research with the ML4ED lab involves explainable AI for education, especially through the lens of reducing adoption barriers for neural networks. Her recent work focuses on uncovering disagreement in post-hoc explainers, using learning science experts to validate explainer accuracy and actionability, and proposing interpretable-by-design neural network architectures.
